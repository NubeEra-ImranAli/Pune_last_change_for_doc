To determine which set of model results is better, let's compare both based on standard performance metrics:

âœ… From Your Table (First Set):
Model	MAE	RMSE	RÂ²
Decision Tree	2.02	10.14	98.86
Random Forest	2.46	10.39	98.80
Linear Regression	32.19	42.70	79.73

âœ… Your New Results (Second Set):
Metric	Value
RÂ² Score	0.9961 â†’ 99.61%
MAE	2.22
RMSE	10.32

ðŸ§  Comparison:
RÂ² (Explained Variance): 0.9961 is better than all others â€” highest in second set.

MAE: 2.22 is very close to Decision Tree (2.02) and better than Random Forest (2.46).

RMSE: 10.32 is slightly worse than Decision Tree (10.14), better than Random Forest (10.39).

âœ… Conclusion:
The second model is best overall because it has the highest RÂ² score (99.61%), indicating better overall prediction accuracy, and it maintains comparable MAE and RMSE.
